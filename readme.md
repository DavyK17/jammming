# Jammming

This is a challenge project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/). The website is a React web app that connects to the user's [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) account and allows them to search for tracks, add them to a new playlist and save the playlist to their account. The web app can be viewed at [dvk-jammming.netlify.app](https://dvk-jammming.netlify.app/).

For the challenge project's feature request, I'll admit that I felt too lazy to draft and implement a new feature request from scratch, so I decided to implement the example provided. Building on the base project, the web app also retrieves a list of existing playlists on the user's account, any of which they can select. The app's state is updated with the selected playlist's ID, name and tracks upon selection, allowing the user to modify the playlist by adding and removing tracks, as well as editing the playlist's name.
